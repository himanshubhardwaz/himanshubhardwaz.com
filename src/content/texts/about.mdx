Growing up, I always had a fascination with how things work, which eventually led me to the world of technology. 
I’m a Full Stack Developer with a genuine love for building things from the ground up. 
My journey started with a simple curiosity that quickly turned into a passion for web development, 
and over the years, I’ve honed my skills to become the developer I am today.


When I’m not coding, you’ll likely find me with a PS5 controller in hand, 
fully immersed in the latest game, or binge-watching science fiction and thriller TV shows. 
I’m also a big fan of F1 and cricket.

One of my most memorable achievements was clearing the National Defence Academy exam. 
Although I was medically rejected, the experience taught me resilience and the importance of hard work, 
lessons that continue to guide me in everything I do.

I’m always eager to connect with others, whether it’s to collaborate on a software project or simply
 share a common interest. Let’s connect and see what we can create together.
