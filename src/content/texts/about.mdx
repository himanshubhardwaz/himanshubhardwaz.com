Passionate Full Stack Engineer with a deep-rooted drive for solving complex problems and building scalable, high-performance applications. My journey started with a dream of becoming an army officer, a goal that pushed me to clear the National Defence Academy exam and interview—one of my proudest achievements. Though a medical rejection changed my path, the resilience, discipline, and problem-solving mindset I developed during that time became the foundation of my approach to software engineering.

Fascinated by how things work, I found a new mission in technology—creating seamless user experiences, optimizing performance, and improving developer efficiency. I’ve worked across the stack, building everything from SDKs and AI-powered automation tools to large-scale search systems. Whether it's frontend, backend, or infrastructure, I thrive on architecting solutions that make an impact.

Beyond work, I contribute to open-source projects, explore emerging technologies, and write about web development best practices. When I’m not coding, you’ll find me gaming on my PS5, diving into science fiction and thriller TV shows, or cheering for my favorite F1 team and cricket stars. Always eager to connect and discuss tech, scaling apps, and innovation!
