Growing up, my dream was to become an army officer, driven by a deep sense of duty and a desire to serve. 
I prepared rigorously and even cleared the National Defence Academy exam and Interview—a moment I still consider one of my greatest achievements. 
Although I was ultimately medically rejected, the experience instilled in me invaluable lessons of resilience, discipline, and the importance of hard work.

Faced with this setback, I channeled my energy and determination into a new path. My fascination with how things work, which had always been a part of me, found a new outlet in technology. 
The discipline and problem-solving mindset I developed during my NDA preparation seamlessly transitioned into my approach to coding.
I began to see software engineering as a way to build, to create, and to solve problems, much like the challenges I had trained for in my pursuit of a military career.

Today, I’m a Full Stack Developer with a genuine passion for building things from the ground up. 
The resilience I learned in my earlier journey continues to drive me in my work, where every line of code is a step towards creating something meaningful. 
When I’m not coding, you’ll find me gaming on my PS5, indulging in science fiction and thriller TV shows, or cheering for my favorite F1 team and cricket players.
