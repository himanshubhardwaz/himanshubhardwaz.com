At the core of Dialworks we used robust tech stack that combines cutting-edge tools and frameworks to deliver a seamless user experience.
We've leveraged <TechPill id="nextjs"/> for the frontend, harnessing its component-based architecture to build dynamic and responsive interfaces. With <TechPill id="typescript"/>, <TechPill id="redux"/>, <TechPill id="tailwind"/> and <TechPill id="nodejs"/>, we've ensured code quality, maintainability, and scalability.
