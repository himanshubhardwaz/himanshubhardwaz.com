The JustCall Dialer SDK is a TypeScript-based library that enables seamless integration of JustCall's dialer functionality into web applications. 
By embedding a dialer iframe into your app, you can manage call events such as ringing, answering, and ending directly through your interface. 
This SDK supports various methods for handling user login, managing call states, and executing actions like dialing numbers, all while ensuring the dialer is in a ready state. 
It's an essential tool for enhancing your application's communication capabilities with JustCall.
